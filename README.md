Our AI-based Women Safety Analytics system utilizes the phone camera to analyze the surrounding environment and detect the number of males and females present. The system identifies potentially risky situations, such as a lone woman surrounded by multiple men or being alone at night. In such cases, an SOS pop-up message automatically appears on the user’s phone, allowing her to quickly send an alert. This alert includes the woman’s current location and situation details, which are then sent directly to the nearest police station or emergency services. This proactive solution enhances women’s safety and enables quicker law enforcement response during emergencies.
